      "Passionate about web development, data analytics, and DSA, I am a 4th-year B.Tech student with hands-on experience in building MERN stack projects. I excel at data analysis and have a knack for integrating AI features into web applications. With a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms, and a track record of successfully deploying web apps, I'm eager to dive into an internship that offers dynamic challenges and a supportive environment to further hone my skills and grow as a developer."
